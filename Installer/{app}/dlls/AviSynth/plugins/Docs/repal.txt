rePal plugin, released by Bach, based on Donald Graft's decimate source.
Brasil, May 2003

This plugin is usefull for a 30->25 IVTC conversion. It must be used in conjunction
with a (smart)bob. It works deleting 7 frames from every group of  12 frames, in 
such way that only blended and/or repeated frames are decimated. It is very
reliable when the source clip is known to be PAL telecined material (most of  
time this is known as 25fps->30fps conversion). Using this plugin you may
achieve better results than telecide(guide=3).decimate(6), since the ghosting effect 
can be avoided. 

The usage is 

#################################
LoadPlugin("rePal.dll")
AVISource("mixed.avi")
bob() ## it is much better to use a smartbob ;). If the result is not good, use complementparity() before. ##
repal()

Theory of opperation:
Most of times, 25fps->30fps conversion is done in a silly way, such that a 
progressive sequence of frames A B C D E F from the source is converted to a 
sequence of fields A, AB, B, BC, C, C, CD, D, DE, E, EF, EF, F … where XY means 
that we have a blended field, and after this this sequence is weaved. Bobbing 
the converted file, we can recover all the progressive frames from the source, 
mixed with blended and repeated frames. The next work is to discard these 
frames only.   

When this filter receives a request for a frame it gets access to a group of 13 
frames, search for the pair of  frames with the smaller difference between then, 
and gets the second frame of this pair as an anchor (in the above example, the 
anchor should be the second C frame). Based on the value of this anchor, it will 
choose the 5 frames from the group of  12 which should be kept. The others will 
be discarded.

Using rePal(show=true), you will have access to the frame which is anchor and the 
frames selected to be kept. In order to understand the log, let 0 be the 2nd frame, 
1 be the 3rd frame, 2 be the 4th frame … from the group of 13 frames. We will keep 
the following frames:

Anchor            keep frames

0           0, 2, 4, 7, 9
1           1, 3, 5, 8, 10
2           2, 4, 6, 9, 11
3           0, 3, 5, 7, 10
4           1, 4, 6, 8, 11
5           0, 2, 5, 7, 9
6           1, 3, 6, 8, 10
7           2, 4, 7, 9, 11
8           0, 3, 5, 8, 10
9           1, 4, 6, 9, 11
10          0, 2, 5, 7, 10
11          1, 3, 6, 8, 11                   

If you want to increase the C match, play with the quality value, using repal(quality=3).
