     Filter is intended for recovering quality of video ripped from DVD
     (for example, when it contains 4 hours of video data),  VideoCD or after
     decompressing by H.261, H.263, DivX 3, DivX 4, XviD.

<p><font size=3>
	Filter automatically determines the blockiness's strength on the frame and
	in the concrete part of it, preserving the maximum of details. Thus, 
	filter will process marginally when on scenes with slow motion, while it will smooth very hard
	in the case of fast motion in the same film.
</font>
<p><font size=3>
	The main advantage of the filter is that it raise the integral quality in
	the most widespread PSNR metric in comparison with original film. That is, a film
	after decompression in comparison with original achieves the lower quality than a film 
	after decompression and deblocking. (But for all that the original film is not used nowise, 
	only decompressed data is used.)

<h3>What's new in version v2.0?</h3>
<font size=3>
<ul>
    <LI> New version in "High quality" mode works 2.1 times faster than v1.2  and  2.4 times faster in "High speed" mode.
    </LI>
	<ul>
	    <LI>Conversions of color spaces optimized (SSE).
	    </LI>
	    <LI>Horizontal deblocking optimized (ллу).
	    </LI>
	    <LI>New option of adjusting speed/quality parameter are available (25% speed improvement).
	    </LI>
	</ul>
    <LI>Quality raised.
    </LI>
	<ul>
	    <LI>Algorithm of automatic detection of blockiness level improved (more details are preserved).
	    </LI>
	    <LI>Chrominance components processing significantly improved.
	    </LI>
	    <LI>All basic deblocking methods changed. Discontinuities along borders of blocks is now absent, image looks more "naturally".
	    </LI>
	</ul>
</ul>
</font>

<h3>What's new in version v2.1?</h3>
<font size=3>
<ul>
    <LI>SSE optimization used only if it is supported by processor and OS
    </LI>
    <LI>Bug fixed: log is not created now
    </LI>
    <LI>Bug fixed: there is now no crashes during processing of frequences in high resolution
    </LI>
</ul>
</font>

<h3>What's new in version v2.2?</h3>
<font size=3>
<ul>
    <LI>Bug fixed: automatic SSE support detection is now works correctly
    </LI>
    <LI>Possibility of manual SSE instructions disabling in case SSE is supported by CPU and OS
    </LI>
</ul>
</font>

<p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<font size=3>
	Filter's interface allows to adjust the quality and the speed of processing.
 	In "High speed" mode optimized version of horizontal deblocking works, which has slightly lower quality
	in comparison to "High quality" mode. In "High speed" mode filter works 25% faster. 
	Using U-deblock & V-deblock it is possible to turn on/off the 
	processing of chrominance components (turning these parameters on 
	noticeably raise the visual quality). 
	Using "SSE instructions" parameter it is possible to disable SSE if it is supported by the CPU and OS.
