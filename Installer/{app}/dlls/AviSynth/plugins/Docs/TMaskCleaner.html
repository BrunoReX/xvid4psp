<h2 id="tmaskcleaner.">TMaskCleaner.</h2>
<p>A really simple mask cleaning plugin for AviSynth based on mt_hysteresis. It discards all areas of less than <strong>length</strong> pixels with values bigger or equal to <strong>thresh</strong>. You probably don't want to use it.</p>
<p>Provided binary is built with vc110.</p>
