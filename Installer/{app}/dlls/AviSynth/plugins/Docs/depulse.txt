Usage instructions and important notes as follows:

# I hardly know any C++. Don't laugh too hard when you see the source code.

# Assumes TFF (top field first) field order interlacing.

# YUY2 only.

# Syntax is: DePulse(clip, h=[0-255], l=[0-255], d=[0-255], debug=[true/false])

# Brightness values of h (high) or less are not targeted as white noise.

# Brightness values of l (low) or more are not targeted as black noise.

# When the pixel and the brightness of the field before and after (..drinking.. top and bottom) are different, it is judged to d (difference) or more that it noises. (white and black noise sharing)

# In debug mode, pixels judged to be black or white noise are coloured pink or green.
